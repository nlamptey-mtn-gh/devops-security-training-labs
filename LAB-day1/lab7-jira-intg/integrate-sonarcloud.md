To integrate SonarCloud with Jira, follow these steps:

Access Jira: Log into your Jira dashboard.

Install SonarCloud App:

Click on "Apps" in the sidebar.
Select "Explore more apps" to open the marketplace.
Search for "SonarQube" in the marketplace.
Locate the "SonarQube Connector for Jira" and click on it.
Click on the "Try it free" button and then select "Start free trial" to install the app.
Configure SonarCloud Settings:

Once the installation is complete, go to your Jira project settings.
Find the section for "Create Jira Issue Settings".
Define what kind of Jira issues will correspond to SonarCloud findings (e.g., map bugs to Jira issues, configure code smells and security hotspots accordingly).
Click on the "Save" button to apply the settings.
Link Projects:

Connect projects from SonarCloud to Jira by navigating to your project's dashboard in Jira.
Ensure that the relevant metrics and issues are being displayed from SonarCloud.
Create Issues:

As SonarCloud reports bugs or vulnerabilities, use the added functionality to create Jira tickets with a click.
Assign the created issues to the relevant developers for remediation.
Monitor Progress:

Check back in Jira to see the status of issues created from SonarCloud, ensuring they are being tracked and addressed over time.
This integration saves manual effort and improves the management of security vulnerabilities in your development workflow.
